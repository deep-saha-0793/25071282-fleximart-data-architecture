Part 2 Overview – NoSQL Database Analysis

Part 2 focuses on evaluating the suitability of MongoDB for FlexiMart’s evolving product catalog and demonstrating basic NoSQL operations using sample product data. As the business expands to include a wider range of products with diverse specifications, the rigid schema of traditional relational databases becomes a limitation. This section blends theoretical analysis with practical implementation to assess MongoDB as an alternative storage solution.

The work is divided into two main tasks:

NoSQL Justification Report:
Students must produce nosql_analysis.md explaining why an RDBMS may not be ideal for highly variable product data and how MongoDB can better support flexible schemas, embedded structures, and horizontal scaling. The report also discusses trade-offs involved in adopting MongoDB, ensuring students understand not only the benefits but also real-world limitations.

MongoDB Operations Implementation:
Using a sample products_catalog.json dataset, students must write mongodb_operations.js to perform essential MongoDB tasks such as importing data, querying documents, performing aggregations, updating nested arrays, and computing analytical summaries. These operations demonstrate how MongoDB handles unstructured data, nested documents, and category-level analysis without schema constraints.

Overall, Part 2 evaluates the student’s ability to compare RDBMS and NoSQL models, justify technology choices based on business needs, and practically implement MongoDB queries and aggregations to manage flexible product catalog data.
